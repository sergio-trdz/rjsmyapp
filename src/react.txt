Anonymous and brief syntax

Stateful and Stateless components

Component's lifecycle
Initial rendering (starts and makes its way to the DOM), Updating Phase (can potentially update and re-render when prop or state change occurs), Unmounting Phase (component is destroyed and removed from the DOM)

Events
Reactions to specific actions like onClick

map returns a new array containing the results of applying an operation on all original array elements
filter returns a new array containing the array elements that passed a specified test condition
reduce reduces all array elements down to one single value
slice returns a new array without values
splice mutates and works as slice
reverse mutates and put values backwards
concat in a variable sums 2 arrays variables together

// componentDidMount() – Executed on the client side only after the first render.
// componentDidUpdate() – Called immediately after rendering takes place.
// componentWillUnmount() – Called after the component is unmounted from the DOM. It is used to clear up the memory spaces.
